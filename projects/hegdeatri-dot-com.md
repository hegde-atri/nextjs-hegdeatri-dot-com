# Personal website [(GitHub)](https://hegdeatri.com)

After a trying out a bunch different frameworks including - yew, blazor, angular and gatsby, I have decided 
to use zola for my website. Reasons being:
- Its very easy to update and add new stuff in markdown.
- Very fast.
- Can build upon an already existing theme, and its templates.

After reading through some excellent docs at [getzola.org](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/),
I chose my theme of choice which was [DeepThought](https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/), and started hacking away at
the config.toml and make my own template for the [about page](https://hegdeatri.com/about).

I plan on making a video that will walk through setting up a small website on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZwj1GpsDQ3B9S5VjeY36A) sometime in the future.

## New design

After about 3 months of using zola, I think I am going to write my own website, will start to write it sometime December 2022. I have already started thinking about what I want to use, and how I will be migrating current posts and data to the new website. I have decided to try out `Next.js` framework. Although I prefer to avoid javascript, maybe its not too bad if its typescript as I do not want to write a blazor application.

You can try out my new website at [https://next.hegdeatri.com](https://next.hegdeatri.com). You can find the github repository for that [here](https://github.com/hegde-atri/nextjs-hegdeatri-dot-com).

You can view the project page for that over [here](/projects/nextjs-hegdeatri-dot-com).
