# Arch Linux Installer [(GitHub)](https://github.com/hegde-atri/arch-install)

Currently v2.0 of this script is in the making. Forgot to branch my commmits out, so if you want to use
it please use `archinstall.sh.bak` file.

## Improvements

Features that are coming to v2.0:
- Disk encryption.
- Option to have different partitions for `/` and `/home`.
- Maybe a TUI.
- My [arch config swapper](https://github.com/hegde-atri/.dotfiles) and also optionally my [wallpapers](https://gitlab.com/linux_things/wallpapers).
