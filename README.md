# next-hegdeatri-dot-com

The second iteration of my personal website. Now using (Next.js + tailwindcss) as opposed to [zola](https://getzola.org) that I had used originally (which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/hegde-atri/hegdeatri-dot-com)).

I will be making a theme repo so that people can use my 'template' and use their own content using markdown files.

### TODO

- make the theme
- add dark mode styles
- make logo
